This project was made for a Hackathon organised by Honda. This is the prototype we made of a system which will make payments through the car dashboad using voice
authentication.

Frontend of the project was made using HTML, CSS and Javascript. 

Backend of the project was made using Firebase.

Voice control and and authentication was done using AlanAI software.
